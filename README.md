# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project introduced me to several coding languages, as well as helped me create a basic webpage. 
I built this webpage using basic HTML. CSS. and JavaScript. This webpage serves as a baseline for me, as well as a place where I can store important notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. While working on this project, I learned how to use these languages and Git together.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
