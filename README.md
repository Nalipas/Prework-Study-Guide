# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project introduced me to several coding languages, as well as helped me create a basic webpage. 
I built this webpage using basic HTML. CSS. and JavaScript. This webpage serves as a baseline for me, or anyone new to coding, as well as a place where I can store important notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. While working on this project, I learned how to use these languages and Git together.
